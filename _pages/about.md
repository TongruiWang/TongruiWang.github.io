I'm a tenure-track associate professor in [School of Mathematical Sciences](https://math.sjtu.edu.cn) at Shanghai Jiao Tong University. 



I received my Ph.D. from the Department of Mathematics at Nanjing University in June 2022 under the supervision of [Prof. Gang Tian](http://tian.bicmr.pku.edu.cn/index.htm).

[//]: <> Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

[//]: <> Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

[//]: <> Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
